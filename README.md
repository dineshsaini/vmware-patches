# vmware-patches

vmware got fucked at every system updates, so this repo will contain my track history for how i got things on road last time. folder structre is `distro/$(uname -r)/{patch,error,version}_file`.

correction: after $uname -r >= 5.19, all patches are combined in the vmmon-only, vmnet-only directories, and Arch dir is now onwards obsolete.
